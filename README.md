# This was the introductory day to GitHUB and version control.
Our porfolio task consisted of:

1. A GitHub repo with the following:
- Minimum 2 branches (including master)
- Minimum 5 commits to each branch
- Evidence the creation of a pull request (screenshots or video)
- A .gitignore file that includes typical entries for a Python repo e.g. Virtual Environment folders
- A README.md file explaining the repo
- Guidance on how to approach this task: I suggest initialising a local repo and adding a code example from Week 1. After the initial commit, make some changes, then cut a new branch and make further changes there. Finally, create a pull request and merge in the changes made on the new branch to master.

2. A short explanation (300 words max) of the differences between Centralised Version Control and Decentralised Version Control (edited)
